# AI-app-prototyping-public
here i am posting various agentic apps that are built on OpenAI APIs to perform a wide range of tasks starting from goal tracking, server management, business engagements and many more...

## New Update : Simplify your code management from your desktop with our easy and fast GitHub sync app. Access the demo interface and get started now.
### Get your own private, browser-based syncing interface for free to manage code from local to GitHub (message for details). App Demo : https://atxinfotech.riff.works/gh-repo-sync
### Test the public app: select code from your local machine and push it to this repository: https://github.com/udaytx009/AI-app-prototyping-public/

## Innovative Project(s) 1/20+ :

# GoalSpace app

This project consists of a FastAPI backend server and a React + TypeScript frontend application.

## Stack

- React+Typescript frontend with `yarn` as package manager.
- Python FastAPI server with `uv` as package manager.

## Quickstart

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
make
```

2. Start the backend and frontend servers in separate terminals:

```bash
make run-backend
make run-frontend
```

## Gotchas

The backend server runs on port 8000 and the frontend development server runs on port 5173. The frontend Vite server proxies API requests to the backend on port 8000.

Visit <http://localhost:5173> to view the application.
